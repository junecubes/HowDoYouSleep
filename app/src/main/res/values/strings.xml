        <br>

            I\'m done hatin\' myself for feelin\' \n </br> <br>
I\'m done cryin\' myself awake \n </br> <br>
I\'ve gotta leave and start the healin\' \n </br> <br>
But when you move like that, I just want to stay \n </br> <br>
        \n </br> <br>
What have I become? \n </br> <br>
Lookin\' through your phone now, oh, now \n </br> <br>
Love to you is just a game \n </br> <br>
Look what I\'ve done \n </br> <br>
Dialing up the numbers on you \n </br> <br>
I don\'t want my heart to break \n </br> <br>
        \n </br> <br>
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? \n </br> <br>
All that shame and all that danger \n </br> <br>
I\'m hopin\' that my love will keep you up tonight \n </br> <br>
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? \n </br> <br>
All that fear and all that pressure \n </br> <br>
I\'m hopin\' that my love will keep you up tonight \n </br> <br>
        \n </br> <br>
Love will keep you up tonight \n </br> <br>
(Tell me how do you) \n </br> <br>
        \n </br> <br>
Oh no, how did I manage to lose me? \n </br> <br>
I am not this desperate, not this crazy \n </br> <br>
There\'s no way I\'m stickin\' \'round to find out \n </br> <br>
I won\'t lose like that, I won\'t lose myself \n </br> <br>
        \n </br> <br>
Look what I\'ve done now \n </br> <br>
Dialin\' up the numbers on you \n </br> <br>
I don\'t want my heart to break \n </br> <br>
        \n </br> <br>
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? \n </br> <br>
All that shame and all that danger \n </br> <br>
I\'m hopin\' that my love will keep you up tonight \n </br> <br>
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? \n </br> <br>
All that fear and all that pressure \n </br> <br>
I\'m hopin\' that my love will keep you up tonight \n </br> <br>
        \n </br> <br>
Yeah \n </br> <br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah \n </br> <br>
Love will keep you up tonight \n </br> <br>
(Tell me how do you) \n </br> <br>
Oh \n </br> <br>
Love will keep you up tonight \n </br> <br>
        \n </br> <br>
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? \n </br> <br>
All that shame and all that danger \n </br> <br>
I\'m hopin\' that my love will keep you up tonight \n </br> <br>
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? (oh) \n </br> <br>
All that fear and all that pressure \n </br> <br>
I\'m hopin\' that my love will keep you up tonight \n </br> <br>
(Tell me how do you) \n </br>
